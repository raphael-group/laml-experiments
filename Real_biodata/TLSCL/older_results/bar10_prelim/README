Preliminary results for barcode 10 of TLSCL (June 1st 2023)
Included files:
+ Input_data: (copied from Palash's directory on the server /n/fs/ragr-data/users/palash/multi-linTracer/data/tlsc/input)
    + bar10_character_matrix.csv: character matrix; used to produce all trees except for bar10_CassILP.nwk
    + bar10_BenLaw_character_matrix.txt: character matrix obtained from Richard (Ben Law's), used to produce bar10_CassILP.nwk
    + bar10_mutation_prior.csv: prior mutation probabilities
+ Competing_methods:
    + bar10_startlenni.nwk: STARTLE-NNI tree, computed by Gillian. A copy from the server /n/fs/ragr-research/projects/problin_experiments/Real_biodata/run_tlscl/out_startle_bar10/startlenni_tree.newick
      * To reproduce: use the script (will run STARTLE for all barcodes): /n/fs/ragr-research/projects/problin_experiments/Real_biodata/run_tlscl/run_startle.sh , which calls /n/fs/ragr-research/projects/problin_experiments/Real_biodata/scripts/run_startle_tlscl_collapse.pl. The script first produces a fully resolved tree than collapses mutationless branches
    + bar10_CassILP.nwk: Cassiopeia-ILP tree, obtained from Richard. A copy from the server /n/fs/ragr-research/projects/problin_experiments/Real_biodata/run_tlscl/process_bar10/cass-ilp/Bar10_newick_noMutationlessEdges_Labeled.nwk
      * NOTE: this tree has only 305 leaves, smaller than the total number of cells (316)
      * To reproduce: (according Richard) max potential graph layer size of 1000 (default of Cassiopeia is 10000)
+ Problin_trees:
    + bar10_multiProgen.nwk: problin results with multi progenitor constraint on tree search. Enforce ultrametric 
    * To reproduce: 
        - Step 1-2: Shared with below.
        - Step 3: Cut independent clades from the t3_r4 tree, and run problin_toposearch with ultrametric constraint only on each of the independent clades. --topology_search --ultrametric --maxIters 2500.
            directory: /n/fs/ragr-research/projects/problin_experiments/Real_biodata/run_tlscl/process_bar10/runjobs/t3_indep_clades
        - Step 4: Stitch the optimized clades together to a root with branch lengths 0 (multi-progenitor model). 
        - Step 5: collapse short branches. We plotted the histogram (30 bins) of branch lengths, and chose a threshold of 0.007 to collapse short branches. Recompute the likelihood. 
        - Step 6: "Replacement"- remove the missing groups other than "missing_3" (6 cells in total), add them back to the tree so that the likelihood is optimized (arbitrary order). Re-optimize branch lengths, phi, and nu afterward.
    + bar10_noConstraint.nwk: problin results without multi progenitor constraint on tree search. Enforce ultrametric
    * To reproduce: 
        - Step 1: build the t3 tree with cluster constraints.
        - Step 2: run problin toposearch with cluster constraints (10 replicates):  --resolve_search --ultrametric --maxruntime 604800. We chose rep4, which had the best likelihood (11508).
            directory: /n/fs/ragr-research/projects/problin_experiments/Real_biodata/run_tlscl/process_bar10/runjobs/t3_trees
        - Step 3: run problin toposearch with no constraints except ultrametric (10 replicates): --topology_search --ultrametric --maxIters 250. We chose rep0, which had the best likelihood (10862).
            directory: /n/fs/ragr-research/projects/problin_experiments/Real_biodata/run_tlscl/process_bar10/runjobs/t3_r4_jumpstart
        - Step 4: run problin toposearch with no constraints except ultrametric again (10 replicates): -topology_search --ultrametric --maxIters 2500. We chose rep rep5, which had the best likelihood (10,447).
            directory: /n/fs/ragr-research/projects/problin_experiments/Real_biodata/run_tlscl/process_bar10/runjobs/t3_r4_r0_jumpstart_parsub/EM_problin_v3_r5.txt
        - Step 5: collapse short branches. We plotted the histogram of branch lengths, and chose a threshold of 0.01 to collapse short branches. Recompute the likelihood.
